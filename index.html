                A big part in why I chose this class was because I wanted to learn HTML and see if web design was a career field I would want to get into. I am all about exploring different career options, and especially in Computer Science, there are so many. Iâ€™m drawn to web design because it allows me to combine creativity with problem-solving, which I find really exciting. I love the idea of being able to create something that is both functional and visually appealing. The ability to build websites that people can interact with and use every day fascinates me. Additionally, web design offers endless opportunities for growth and learning as technology is always evolving, which is a big motivator for me to continue exploring this field. So far in the class, I am enjoying what we are learning and I hope to become an expert in HTML by the time the class ends.
